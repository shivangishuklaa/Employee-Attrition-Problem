📌 About
This project applies supervised learning algorithms to predict whether an employee will leave the company based on key features such as satisfaction level, job role, salary, and working hours. The goal is to help organizations identify potential attrition risks and improve employee retention strategies.

🧠 Project Workflow
1. 🔍 Data Exploration & Cleaning
•	Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
•	Encoded categorical variables (Label Encoding & One-Hot Encoding)
•	Normalized/standardized numerical features
2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Analyzed patterns in attrition across departments, salary levels, and job satisfaction
•	Visualized relationships between features and attrition using Seaborn & Matplotlib
3. 🛠️ Feature Engineering
•	Selected important features based on correlation and business logic
•	Scaled features for better model convergence
4. 🤖 Model Building
Trained and tested multiple classification models:
•	Logistic Regression
•	Decision Tree
•	Random Forest
•	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. 📈 Evaluation
•	Evaluated models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix
•	Random Forest achieved the best performance with ~87% accuracy
